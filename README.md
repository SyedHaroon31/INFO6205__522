Problem Statement:The traveling salesman problem (TSP) is a popular mathematics problem that asks for the most efficient trajectory possible given a set of points and distances that must all be visited. It is a well known and important combinatorial optimization problem. The goal is to find the   shortest tour that visits each city in a given list exactly once and then returns to the starting city, given a collection of cities and the cost of travel between each pair of them.
